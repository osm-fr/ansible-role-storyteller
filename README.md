Storyteller
=========

Installs and configure Nginx, PHP5-FPM, Mysql and Wordpress in Ubuntu (trusty 14.04).

This role will apply some recommended security settings when setting up the Mysql database, like deleting anonymous user and the test database.
This role will also fetch random salts from the [wordpress salt API](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) to apply in the wordpress config file.

Requirements
------------

To run this role in your playbook, you need to set 2 environment variables: MYSQL_ROOT_PASS and WP_DB_PASS.
The first one is the desired password to the root user in Mysql. The second one is the password for the wordpress user in Mysql.

Role Variables
--------------

The password to root user in Mysql, the default value comes from the environment variable MYSQL_ROOT_PASS.
It's not recommended to override this variable to a fixed value in the playbook, use a environment variable instead.
```

```

```
